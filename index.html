            - I think Addy Osmani has a good, succinct explanation
            - for those who don't know him, he's an engineer at Google and has some famous open source projects like Yeoman and Todo MVC
            - so it's a website that appears like a native app to the user
            - "modern web capabilities" is an important phrase here but we'll come to that later
            - they morphe from a normal website to immersive apps

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              But let me describe in a bit more detail what PWAs can do.
              <strong>Homescreen access</strong>
              - when a user visits a website a couple of times, they see a prompt to ask if they wish to add the app to the homescreen of their device. This is called a "smart install banner"

              <strong>Full screen mode</strong>
              - when opening the app through tapping on the icon on the homescren, the browser tabs and URL bar disappear, so it looks like you're looking at a native app.

            <h2>Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
            <p>Add to the homescreen</p>
            <p>Full-screen mode</p>
            <p class="fragment">Splash screen</p>
            <p class="fragment">Push notifications</p>
            <p class="fragment">Exists in app switcher</p>
            <p class="fragment">Works offline! üëØ</p>
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              <strong>Splash screen</strong>
              - can be implemented to display when the app opens

              <strong>Push notifications</strong>
              - You  might know this from Slack when you use it in the browser. It asks you if you want to receive push notifications.
              With PWAs it's possible to even send push notifications when the app is closed.

              <strong>Android app switcher</strong>
              - When you're switching between apps it looks like an app with its own icon. It doesn't look like it's part of Chrome.

              <strong>Offline</strong>
              - and it finally solves a problem that has existed ever since the internet was invented: you have to be online to use it.

          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            Responsive

            - as developers we don't need to build different apps for iOS and Android and Windows phone, but only one responsive website is enough.

            Linkable

            - as in: it has a URL. Easier to share with others, but what's probably even more important is that search engines can find it and index it.

            No app stores

            - from a user perspective it's great because they don't need to download the app but they can just start using it straight away
            - from a developer perspective we don't need to submit it to the app store and go through approval process but can iterate really quickly.

            Browser support

            - there is one big downside at the moment, as with any new shiny front end web technology... and that is browser support. At the moment only on Chrome for Android and Opera for Android. Firefox for Android it's in beta. MS Edge: under development and Webkit: under consideration. Which means for iPhone users: forget it. (For now.)
            Webkit is a layout engine in browsers. Powers Safari.
            Chromium based browsers are Chrome and Opera, it's a fork of Webkit.

            Complexity

            - as you will see later, the caching strategies can get quite complex.

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              - can intercept and handle network requests
              - cannot access the DOM directly but can communicate with your other JavaScript via the postMessage() interface
              - it is not tied to a specific web page
              - HTTPS for security reasons. Service workers let you hijack connections and change HTTP responses. Powerful stuff and with great power comes great responsiblity. To make sure it can't be tampered with, you can use it over HTTPS only.

            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
              Enhanced online experience

              - by controlling the caching of content, so that it doesn't need to download certain files every time (for example stylesheets or javascript)
              - pre-service worker there was (and still is) something called AppCache. Works in all browsers but Chrome, Firefox are planning to stop support for it. There were issues with it e.g. AppCache can't be partially updated, there were security issues with it and usability problems.

              Offline experience

              - you can define what happens when a user tries to use your site or app without a network connection. For example you could have an offline fallback page (the Guardian developer blog has a crossword puzzle)

              Background data synchronisation

              - service worker can be started up even when the user isn't on the website, so it can update its cache.
              - but from what I've read this capability is not available yet

            <!--- if your browser doesn't have a service worker yet for the website, then it needs to connect itself up first. It creates an install event, that we can listen for in our code.-->
            <!--- during install step we typically cache some assets like stylesheet or front end JS file-->

            <!--- if any files fail to download, the installation step will fail and the service worker won't activate. Good thing: you can trust that your static assets are available when the service worker gets used.-->

            <!--- when your browser sees a new service worker, after it installs, it activates it, triggering the activate event.-->
            <!--- during the activate phase, clean up of previous versions of the service worker and get rid of old caches-->
            <!--- after activation, the service worker will deal with all pages in its remit-->
            <!--- then the service worker will be idle and either be terminated to save memory-->
            <!--- or it will deal with any fetch events (when a network request is made or a message is received)-->

          <h2>Demo time!</h2>
          <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
            - service worker heavily relies on the promises API.
            - JavaScript is single threaded but with promises we can perform asynchronous computations.
            - a Promise represents a single asynchronous operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future
            - can be chained with callback functions
