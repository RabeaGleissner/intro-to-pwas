I also wrote a blog post with similar content. [Find it on the 8th Light blog](https://8thlight.com/blog/rabea-gleissner/2016/09/14/intro-to-progressive-web-apps.html).

I'm using the [reveal.js presentation framework](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). Thanks to [Hakim](https://github.com/hakimel) for sharing his code!
